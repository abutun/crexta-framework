    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>In building web applications, often the form elements and the text used to label them is 
    /// not intrinsically connected (with a &lt;label&gt; tag for instance). In addition the HTML
    /// that is rendered in ASP.NET can have changing id/name at each change to the ASPX page. 
    /// This makes it hard to find form elements and keep the test cases effective without a lot
    /// of re-coding and fixing.</para>
    /// <para>As a human we can look at a web page and (usually) know what information should go into
    /// a form field based on the label. This is because we visually associate nearby text to the
    /// field. This class uses the same concept by measuring proximity of the text to field elements
    /// and giving a "best guess" to the element desired.</para>

    /// <item>Currently this class assume left-to-right layout. A future enhancement could look at

    /// if the text can be found. This isn't exactly what we as humans do. A future enhancement could
    /// change the algorithm to identify the closest text that appears to label the field for all fields.</item>
